When summer’s in the city,
And brick’s a blaze
of heat,
The Ice-cream Man with his little cart
Goes trundling down the street.
Beneath his round umbrella,
Oh, what a joyful sight,
To see him fill the cones with mounds
Of cooling brown and white: 
Vanilla, chocolate, strawberry,
Or chilly things to drink
From bottles full of frosty-fizz,
Green, orange, white, or pink.
His cart might be a flower bed,
Of roses and sweet peas,
The way the children cluster round
As thick as honeybees.

“What are you going to do with those

“You cannot waste all these bits and

Recycling waste
Folk tales
Multi-cultural appr
oach to food
To avoid wastage of food
In every country of the world, there are stories which have been handed down from
grandparents to grandchildren or which have been sung by mothers to their babies.
These stories are called and tell us about the customs and culture of the place
they are set in.
A Kerala folk tale and a Santhal folk tale have been retold in this unit. The teacher
should encourage children to read folk tales from different parts of the country. The
mother tongue can be given its due place by being used for discussion and
understanding, along with teaching of English.
The and activities should be done through imitation — the teacher
first and then the children. Poems could be recited in groups. They may also be
presented through dramatisation, actions etc. in the school assembly. The children
can make big cutouts of ice creams and vegetables or dress up as particular
vegetables or ice-cream and recite the poem. You could think of a suitable rhythm for
the poem.
The section can begin with a discussion started by the teacher, in this case
on environment and recycling of waste. This can be done with the help of a practical
example of children making paper bags from old newspaper. These bags could
be given to the neighbourhood provision store to be used instead of plastic bags.
Remember, paper bags are environment friendly. Old newspapers can also be
used to make envelopes of different sizes and masks for school plays.
When we use several sentences to tell others about something that we have
seen, read, heard or done, it is called a report. For the teacher,
along with the children, should first go through the report on Uncle Lal's farm.
The children can then do the guided report on ice creams available in their area
or on food, toyshops, soaps, some animal, care of pets etc.
A creative activity should be followed by a presentation before the entire class.
The poems, recipes, the findings of any task etc. could be done as group
activities and presented or displayed in the classroom. This sharing is as
important an experience as any individual activity.Ice-cream Man
