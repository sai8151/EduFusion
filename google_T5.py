OPERATORS
The two previous sections examined two different roles for prior knowledge in
learning: initializing the learner's hypothesis and altering the objective function
that guides search through the hypothesis space. In this section we consider a
third way of using prior knowledge to alter the hypothesis space search: using
it to alter the set of operators that define legal steps in the search through the
hypothesis space. This approach is followed by systems such as FOCL (Pazzani
et al. 1991; Pazzani and Kibler 1992) and ML-SMART (Bergadano and Giordana
1990). Here we use FOCL to illustrate the approach.
12.5.1 The FOCL Algorithm
FOCL is an extension of the purely inductive FOIL system described in Chap-
ter 10. Both FOIL and FOCL learn a set of first-order Horn clauses to cover the
observed training examples. Both systems employ a sequential covering algorithm
that learns a single Horn clause, removes the positive examples covered by this
new Horn clause, and then iterates this procedure over the remaining training
examples. In both systems, each new Horn clause is created by performing a
general-to-specific search, beginning with the most general possible Horn clause
(i.e., a clause containing no preconditions). Several candidate specializations of
the current clause are then generated, and the specialization with greatest infor-
mation gain relative to the training examples is chosen. This process is iterated,
generating further candidate specializations and selecting the best, until a Horn
clause with satisfactory performance is obtained.
The difference between FOIL and FOCL lies in the way in which candidate
specializations are generated during the general-to-specific search for a single Horn
clause. As described in Chapter 10, FOIL generates each candidate specialization
by adding a single new literal to the clause preconditions. FOCL uses this same
method for producing candidate specializations, but also generates additional spe-
cializations based on the domain theory. The solid edges in the search tree of Fig-
ure 12.8 show the general-to-specific search steps considered in a typical search by
FOIL. The dashed edge in the search tree of Figure 12.8 denotes an additional can-
didate specialization that is considered by FOCL and based on the domain theory.
Although FOCL and FOIL both learn first-order Horn clauses, we illustrate
their operation here using the simpler domain of propositional (variable-free) Horn
clauses. In particular, consider again the Cup target concept, training examples,
and domain theory from Figure 12.3. To describe the operation of FOCL, we must
first draw a distinction between two kinds of literals that appear in the domain
theory and hypothesis representation. We will say a literal is operational if it is
allowed to be used in describing an output hypothesis. For example, in the Cup
example of Figure 12.3 we allow output hypotheses to refer only to the 12 at-
tributes that describe the training examples (e.g., HasHandle, HandleOnTop).
Literals based on these 12 attributes are thus considered operational. In contrast,
literals that occur only as intermediate features in the domain theory,"""
